Hangman game in Python

Installation:

Install python https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install an IDE, I used PyCharm but feel free to use whatever works for you. https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
After doing all of that, you should be able to get the files for the game from this github, put it into the IDE and run it. For The Great Skeleton War, you have to run Hangman.py to launch the actual game.

File Descriptions

Hangman.py file with source code is attached.
